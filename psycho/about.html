                    Let’s be real. Living a life marked by honesty and realness takes the
                    guesswork out of approaching novel situations and relationships.

                    I know from firsthand experience how fragmented we can feel without
                    reflection and self-discovery. I work with individuals to identify
                    these cycles and decide where to disrupt them.

                <h3>All emotions are valid</h3>
                <p>We tend to question our emotions in efforts to clear up confusion, but I find this actually leads to
                    even more uncertainty. I encourage patients to think of their emotions as valid but stemming from
                    possible irrational thoughts. In changing our thoughts, we can develop more positive feelings</p>
            </div>

            <div class="approach-card">
                <h3>Emotions are instinct</h3>
                <p>In situations or relationships we’ve never been in before, all we have are our instincts. I think of
                    emotions as our instincts and by nurturing our relationship with them, we will always be equipped to
                    take on whatever is in front of us. Knowing our instincts means knowing ourselves.</p>

            <div class="approach-card">
                <h3>Tough love doesn’t work</h3>
                <p>In order to push ourselves and achieve our goals, we tend to be hard on ourselves. But we go too far
                    and judge ourselves for our efforts in the process. I help others in understanding how this is
                    actually an obstacle rather than a motivator and encourage self-compassion and acknowledging of
                    strengths.</p>

            <div class="approach-card">
                <h3>It’s all connected</h3>
                <p>So much of our distress comes from feeling fragmented and not knowing ourselves. I help patients look
                    at the pieces of themselves and discover how they fit together. Even if we may not know the end
                    result, this process can be incredibly exciting and rewarding.</p>
